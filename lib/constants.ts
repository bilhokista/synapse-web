 * The app's monospace stack.

 * The variable is defined by `next/font` in `app/layout.tsx`, which self-hosts
 * the face and generates its own family name — so the literal string
 * "IBM Plex Mono" no longer resolves to anything and must not be used.
 *
 * Form controls do not inherit `font-family` from `body`, so buttons, inputs
 * and selects still need this applied explicitly rather than relying on the
 * cascade.
